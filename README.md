## Description

Inventory Manager allows a fictional company to track parts and products for manufacturing and selling bicycles. 
This program was designed and developed for a Software class project. It uses a Java backend, and JavaFX for the GUI.

The main GUI comprises two tables: a Parts table and a Products table. This allows the user to manage both
aspects of the company's inventory system. Existing parts and products can be searched from their respective search bars. 
When creating or modifying products, in-stock parts needed to "build" the product can be added or removed.

## Instructions

To run the program, enter the following into the command line:

```bash
$ cd inventory-management/out/artifacts/inventory_management_jar
$ java -jar inventory-management.jar
```

## IDE, SDK, and Libraries
